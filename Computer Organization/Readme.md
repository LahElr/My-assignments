A maze runs on the Xilinx FPGA.

The project has 2 parts: hardware and software.

For hardware, I implemented a 5-stage multi-cycle 32-bits MIPS CPU, RAM, and peripherals for keypad input and VGA output.

For software, I implemented a simple maze program in MIPS-32 in which you can control a randomly-changing-size circle to pass a maze.

Some of the codes and all `.ngc` files comes from teachers of this course at Zhejiang University and thus please don't repost any of the `.ngc` files.
