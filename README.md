# My-assignments

Summary of all my assignments undergraduate stage

This is a summary repo to make my repo page tidier and I will transfer all other assignment repos to this repo.

The names of the schedules here are not their formal names.

For my teamwork project at NLP course, please refer to https://github.com/NLP-VQA

For my teamwork project at Software Engineering course, please refer to https://github.com/Ais0n/healthsys

For my teamwork project at Compiler Theory course, please refer to https://github.com/LahElr/sysy-alter-compiler

My works about Verilog in Digital Logic Design / Computer Organization / Computer Architecture courses are in a chaotic situation so I'll update that part later.
