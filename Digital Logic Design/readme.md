A maze running on Xilinx FPGA, with keypad as input and VGA as output.

Teamwork with https://github.com/chronoby but most of the codes are my work.

In the maze:

* players can only see terrains around the character
* there're 2 traps  hide in the map
* there's a trigger block, when player step on it, a wall block will open

The picture is other's work, so if you want to use, change the picture to your own.
