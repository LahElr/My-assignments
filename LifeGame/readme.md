My final project of Fundamental C programming, maybe the latest version. The file structure 3 years ago is of a bit chaos.

This is a C++ project and depends on EasyX graphic libaray. Please refer to EasyX at https://easyx.cn/

This project has been tested on MSVC in Windows system.

There are 3 music called a.mp3, b.mp3 and c.mp3, they're not here due to copyright stuff, if you want to compile and use this project, you can use your own.
